# C-Bitmap-Raycaster
A C++ implementation of a raycaster using bitmap images

To-do : 
* add control explanation
* add input/output explanation
* add code explanation

## Overview
This is a project of creating a raycaster similar to the one used in Wolfenstein 3D. All of the code(main.cpp, bmputil.h) and the folders(input, output, screenshots) 
must be included in the same relative positions for the code to properly work.
