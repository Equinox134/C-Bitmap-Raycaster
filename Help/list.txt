camloc {mode} [x] [y]: changes camera location, [x] and [y] are floats
	modes:
	add: adds [x], [y] to current cameras x and y positions
	set: sets camera positions to ([x], [y])
camrot {mode} [r]: changes camera rotation, [r] is a float
	modes:
	add: adds [r] degrees to current camera rotation
	set: sets camera rotation to [r] degrees
floorcl [r] [g] [b]: change floor color to {[r], [g], [b]}, [r]~[b] are integers
